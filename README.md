For your README file, you’ll want to focus on making it informative, clear, and engaging. Here’s a structure to help guide you in generating content for your GitHub project. Since this is for your suicidal thought detection app, I’ve tailored the outline to fit this project:

## Project Overview
The **Suicidal Thought Detection App** is an AI-powered tool designed to identify suicidal thoughts based on text data. The app was trained using a dataset of suicidal and non-suicidal posts from Reddit. It uses natural language processing and a GRU-based model to differentiate between posts that may express suicidal intent and those that do not. This tool aims to support mental health professionals in early detection and intervention.

## Features
- **Suicidal Thought Detection:** Classifies text as either suicidal or non-suicidal.
- **Configurable:** Users can adjust parameters like thresholds for detection sensitivity.
- **Extendable:** The model can be further trained to detect other mental health conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For model building and training.
- **Google Colab**: For training the model in a cloud environment.
- **Anvil UI Framework**: For hosting the model, build User Interface and access the model.

## Model Architecture
This project utilizes a sequential model with the following layers:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: Processes the sequence of word embeddings and retains relevant information.
- **Dense Layer**: Final classification layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/cs4lakshmi/LifePulseAI.git
   ```
2. **Run the app**:
   - **Train the model**: 
     ```bash
     python suicide_detection_app_challenge.py
     ```
   - **Use the model through the user interface**:
     ```bash
     Access the UI : https://suicide-detection.anvil.app/
     Enter text and click on DETECT button.
     ```

## Data
The model was trained on a dataset collected from Reddit. It contains over 230,000 text samples labeled as either suicidal or non-suicidal. The data was preprocessed by tokenizing the text, removing stopwords, and normalizing the words.

## Performance
The app has demonstrated strong performance in classifying suicidal thoughts:
- **GRU Model Accuracy**: 93.8% on the test set.
- **LSTM Model Accuracy**: 92.8% on the test set.
The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust classification.

## Future Improvements
- **Model Accuracy**: Explore additional layers or transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy.
- **Mental Health Classification**: Extend the model to detect other mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression.
- **Real-time Detection**: Implement a real-time API for immediate text analysis and feedback.
